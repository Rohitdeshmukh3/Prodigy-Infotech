#  Responsive Landing Page  

##  Project Overview  
This project is part of my **Web Development Internship at Prodigy InfoTech** (Task-01).  

I built a **Responsive Landing Page** with a fully interactive **navigation bar** that adapts across devices.  
The project showcases **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** working together to create smooth animations, interactivity, and responsive layouts.
